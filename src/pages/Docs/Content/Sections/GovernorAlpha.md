BTRUST Governor Alpha
--------------

BTRUST Governor Alpha is the governance module of the protocol; it allows addresses with more than 2,500,000 BTRUST to propose changes to the protocol. Addresses that held voting weight, at the start of the proposal, invoked through the getpriorvotes function, can submit their votes during a 3 day voting period. If a majority, and at least 25,000,000 votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after 7 days.
