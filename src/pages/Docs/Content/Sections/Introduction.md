Introduction
------------

BTRUST protocol is governed and upgraded by BTRUST token-holders, using three distinct components; the BTRUST token, governance module (GovernorAlpha), and Timelock. Together, these contracts allow the community to propose, vote, and implement changes through the administrative functions of GovernanceDecsions. Proposals can include changes like adjusting the marketplace fee.

Any address with more than 2,500,000 BTRUST delegated to it may propose governance actions, which are executable code. When a proposal is created, the community can submit their votes during a 3 day voting period. If a majority, and at least 25,000,000 votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after 7 days. The proposal minimum delegate amount, the voting delay, and voting period can be changed through governance.
